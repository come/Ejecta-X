## How to use

###Setup and Install for Android:

1. Install [Android NDK](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html) first.
2. Install [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) then Eclipse and ADT OR, [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)
3. Building:
	- With NDK CLI: `cd project/android/jni/source` then run `/path/to/your/android-ndk-r9/ndk-build` to compile libejecta.so and libJavaScriptCore.so
	- With Eclipse: Open `project/android/` in Eclipse, change the NDK build phase [1] [2] to point to your NDK path. The C/C++ configuration uses NDK API level 14 and GNU 4.8; you can adapt this to your needs.
4. Build in your IDE or with ant.

**Note for Windows users:-**

Current branches no longer work on Windows after the OpenGLES update. Please use the older release [https://github.com/aogilvie/Ejecta-X/releases/tag/v0.9.9-original](https://github.com/aogilvie/Ejecta-X/releases/tag/v0.9.9-original)

### Sample

For an example application in the `sample` folder, name `Ejecta-X.apk`.

For XHR, remember to add ```<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>``` to the Android Manifest.

### Native Events

**Register for Java Events**

Set an event listener on your activity as follows;

	((EjectaGLSurfaceView)mGLView).setEjectaEventListener(new EjectaRenderer.EjectaEventListener() {
        @Override
        public void onCanvasCreated() {

    	}
	});

### Native APIs

**loadJavaScriptFile(String filename)**

Will load a JavaScript file into Ejecta-X. File should be relative from ```assets/build/<filename>```.

For example to load a file at ```assets/build/loadme.js``` would be;

	((EjectaGLSurfaceView)mGLView).loadJavaScriptFile("loadme.js")
